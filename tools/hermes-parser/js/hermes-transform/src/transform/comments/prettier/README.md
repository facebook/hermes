# Comment Attachment

This is a fork of prettier's comment attachment algorithm. The original license for `prettier` can be found in the `PRETTIER_LICENCE` file in the root of this package.
Specifically this fork contains the `attach` method from [`src/main/comments.js`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/894f841fbd948875fc2a47bd63f3db3dcadc5f43/src/main/comments.js#L357) and the minimum set of code required for it.

The folder structure has been maintained to make merging future updates easier.
