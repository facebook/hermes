//! # Semantic Analyzer
//!
//! This module performs semantic analysis of the AST. That includes resolving
//! identifiers to corresponding declarations, resolving `break`/`continue`
//! targets, and performing validation (things like assigning to a non-lvalue,
//! names disallowed in strict mode, etc).
