// REQUIRES: jit

// Property access: the three-tier GetById inline cache (object
// specialization, parent specialization, generic read property cache), the
// PutById runtime path, GetByVal/DelByVal/IsIn, and globals
// (GetGlobalObject/DeclareGlobalVar).
//
// The first four RUN lines are the real check -- interpreter and JIT must
// print the same thing, at -O and -O0, with and without the type asserts.
// The fifth repeats the differential in threshold mode, which is the only
// mode in which the specialized tiers are emitted at all (see below). The
// two -Xdump-jitcode=2 lines pin that the functions under test were in fact
// compiled, so the differential cannot degrade into comparing the
// interpreter against itself. The COUNT line proves emitted code both calls
// (NumCall) and takes the slow call path (NumCallSlow), which it does here
// because a compiled function now reaches `print` through the global object.
//
// Every differential RUN line carries -Xjit-crash-on-error, because nothing
// in this file declines in any of the five modes. The -O0 ones could not
// until the exceptions milestone: the implicit derived constructor contains
// a ThrowIfEmpty, which declined there. It compiles now, and the CHECK0 set
// below pins it.
//
// GLOBALS. Globals themselves are covered here -- `bump` reads and writes a
// module-level `var` and `report` reaches `print` through the global object,
// both from compiled code. `global` itself is pinned here now too: it used
// to decline on the string literals in the top-level code below (`"acc"`,
// `"alpha"`, `"beta"`, `"extra"`), which needed LoadConstString, and this
// header said so and pointed at globals.js for the pin. LoadConstString
// landed in milestone 5, `global` compiles at both -O and -O0, and the pin
// below says so. globals.js remains the file that pins `global` in
// ISOLATION, with no string constant anywhere in it, which is a different
// and still useful guarantee.
//
// THE SPECIALIZED TIERS NEED A WARM CACHE. Both specializations are emitted
// only when the site's ReadPropertyCacheEntry already has
// numGoodChanges == 1, i.e. only when the function ran interpreted before it
// was compiled. Under -Xjit=force every function is compiled before its
// first call, so its caches are cold and only the generic tier is ever
// emitted. That is why the SPEC RUN line uses threshold mode instead: getX
// reads an own property, which selects the object-specialization tier, and
// callSum reads a method off the prototype, which selects the
// parent-specialization tier. Together they are the only coverage in this
// suite of the two tiers that compare HiddenClass lazy JIT ids -- the ids
// pinned through usedHCs by initHCLazyIDMayAlloc, and the only coverage
// anywhere of emit_sh_cp_decode_non_null_preserve_input, which lives inside
// the object-specialization tier and nowhere else. Strings landing did not
// disturb this: threshold mode still runs each function interpreted before
// compiling it, so the caches still warm, and the SPEC lines below still
// match. DO NOT convert this RUN line to -Xjit=force.
//
// NOT exercised BY THIS FILE, and why -- as of milestone 5 none of these
// decline anymore (verified by hand: super[k] read/write, private fields and
// methods, computed-key getter/setter definitions and array-literal defines
// all compile and match the interpreter). This file simply does not happen
// to construct those shapes; they have their own coverage elsewhere:
//  - Property names as string values. `o["x"]`, `delete o.x` and `"x" in o`
//    needed LoadConstString; every by-val site here still takes its key
//    from a parameter, which is what makes the by-val opcodes rather than
//    the by-id ones fire. strings.js covers the const-key forms of all
//    three.
//  - getByValWithReceiver / putByValWithReceiver: emitted for `super[k]`
//    and assignment through it, which needs a computed key. Not built here;
//    confirmed separately to compile and match under -Xjit=force.
//  - Private names (addOwnPrivateBySym and friends) and
//    defineOwnGetterSetterByVal: emitted from class bodies. Not built here;
//    confirmed separately to compile and match, including a private method
//    call and a computed-key accessor pair, under -Xjit=force.
//  - defineOwnInDenseArray / defineOwnByIndex: array-literal opcodes,
//    covered by arrays.js.
//  - getOwnBySlotIdx: emitted only for PrLoadInst, which comes from typed
//    (Flow) class IRGen, so it is not reachable from plain JS at all --
//    the same situation as typedLoadParent, and unrelated to what compiles
//    or declines. putOwnBySlotIdx IS reachable and is covered by `nested`
//    below, but only at -O; at -O0 a literal lowers to NewObject plus
//    DefineOwnById instead.
