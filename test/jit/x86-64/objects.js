// REQUIRES: jit

// Objects and object-literal buffers: NewObject, NewObjectWithParent,
// NewObjectWithBuffer (the inline young-gen allocation of the object plus,
// past five properties, its indirect property storage) and
// NewObjectWithBufferAndParent, plus InstanceOf. The first RUN line is the
// real check -- interpreter and JIT must print the same thing. The second
// re-runs it with the type asserts on. The last two pin that the functions
// under test were in fact compiled, so the differential cannot degrade into
// comparing the interpreter against itself.
//
// Every object here is BUILT by compiled code and READ by the interpreter:
// reading a property still declines (getById), so a function that touched
// `o.a` would not compile and would prove nothing. `global` declines too, on
// DeclareGlobalVar, which is why the reads at the bottom of the file run
// interpreted.
//
// The literals are all-constant on purpose. A literal with a computed value
// lowers to NewObjectWithBuffer followed by PutOwnBySlotIdx for that value,
// and PutOwnBySlotIdx still declines, so such a function would not compile.
// The same applies to nested literals ({x: {y: 1}}) and to array literals.
//
// The -O0 RUN lines carry far fewer status pins than the -O ones, and that
// is not an oversight: at -O0 there is no literal buffer at all. Every
// non-empty literal lowers to NewObject followed by one DefineOwnById per
// property, and DefineOwnById declines. So at -O0 only the three functions
// with no property definitions compile -- empty (NewObject), proto
// (NewObjectWithParent) and isa (InstanceOf) -- and those three are what the
// CHECK0 lines pin. NewObjectWithBuffer coverage is -O only.
//
// The NewObjectWithBuffer slow path (_jit_new_empty_object_for_buffer) is
// covered without any special arrangement: the hidden class it loads is a
// WeakRoot that the RuntimeModule only fills in on the first execution of
// that site, and -Xjit=force compiles each function before its first call,
// so every literal here takes the slow path once and the fast path forever
// after. That first pass is also what exercises the emitter's assumption
// that the property storage sits directly after the object, since on the
// slow path the two cells come from JSObject::create rather than from
// alloc2InYoung.
//
// NOT covered, and why:
//  - `new` with a property-storing constructor. The construct call site
//    itself compiles and is covered by calls.js, but a constructor that
//    stores into `this` does not: a function constructor's body declines on
//    PutByIdLoose, a class constructor's on GetById, and a derived class
//    constructor additionally on ThrowIfThisInitialized. Naming the
//    constructor as a global adds GetGlobalObject to the caller on top of
//    that. Task 2 lands getById/putById and getGlobalObject, which makes
//    this reachable; ThrowIfThisInitialized waits for the exceptions
//    milestone.
//  - loadParentNoTraps: emitted only for `super` -- a super method call, a
//    super property read, or the implicit callee load in a derived
//    constructor. Every one of those functions also contains getById,
//    getByIdWithReceiver or throwIfThisInitialized, all of which decline, so
//    no function containing LoadParentNoTraps compiles today. It is ported
//    and unreachable; coverage has to come with the property milestone.
//  - typedLoadParent: emitted only from typed-class IRGen, i.e. not from
//    plain JS at all.
//  - newTypedObjectWithBuffer: likewise typed-class only.
//  - newObjectWithBufferSlow: reached when a shape has more properties than
//    fit a young-gen allocation, or when a literal holds a double that
//    cannot be stored inline. In this build the first threshold is past two
//    thousand properties and the second never triggers, since HV64
//    SmallHermesValue inlines every double. A literal large enough to reach
//    it would dominate this file for no extra signal.
