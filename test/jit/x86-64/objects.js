// REQUIRES: jit

// Objects and object-literal buffers: NewObject, NewObjectWithParent,
// NewObjectWithBuffer (the inline young-gen allocation of the object plus,
// past five properties, its indirect property storage) and
// NewObjectWithBufferAndParent, plus InstanceOf. The first RUN line is the
// real check -- interpreter and JIT must print the same thing. The second
// re-runs it with the type asserts on. The last two pin that the functions
// under test were in fact compiled, so the differential cannot degrade into
// comparing the interpreter against itself.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THE OTHER PROCESS, NOT THE OTHER HALF OF THIS ONE. When
// this file was written every read here was performed by the interpreter,
// because `global` declined and could not be compiled; the header said so
// and leaned on it. That is no longer true. TypeOf and LoadConstString both
// landed in milestone 5, and `global` -- the only function in this file
// that used either -- now compiles at both -O and -O0, so the whole program
// runs as emitted code. What checks it is the first RUN line's separate
// `%hermes %s` process, which has no JIT at all. Nothing in this file needs
// an interpreted reader any more, and nothing here is written to avoid one.
//
// The literals are all-constant on purpose, but not because a computed
// value would fail to compile any more. A literal with a computed value
// lowers to NewObjectWithBuffer followed by PutOwnBySlotIdx for that value,
// and PutOwnBySlotIdx landed with props.js's `nested`; confirmed separately
// that a literal with a parameter-derived value, a nested literal
// ({x: {y: 1}}), and an array literal with a computed element all compile
// and match the interpreter now. This file keeps its literals all-constant
// anyway, since that is what isolates the buffer-fill path under test from
// the by-slot-idx store path, which has its own coverage in props.js.
//
// EVERY FUNCTION HERE COMPILES AT BOTH -O AND -O0, so the CHECK and CHECK0
// pin sets are identical and the differential RUN lines carry
// -Xjit-crash-on-error: a decline is a regression and must abort rather than
// quietly hand the function back to the interpreter. This too used to be
// false. At -O0 there is no literal buffer -- every non-empty literal
// lowers to NewObject plus one DefineOwnById per property -- and while
// DefineOwnById declined only `empty`, `proto` and `isa` compiled. The
// property milestone landed DefineOwnById, which brought `six`, `fat`,
// `shapeA`/`B`/`C` and `protoBuf` in; `small`, `wide`, `churn`,
// `churnSmall` and `global` still needed LoadConstString for their string
// literals and came in with milestone 5. NewObjectWithBuffer coverage is
// still -O only, since the buffer form itself does not exist at -O0.
//
// The NewObjectWithBuffer slow path (_jit_new_empty_object_for_buffer) is
// covered without any special arrangement: the hidden class it loads is a
// WeakRoot that the RuntimeModule only fills in on the first execution of
// that site, and -Xjit=force compiles each function before its first call,
// so every literal here takes the slow path once and the fast path forever
// after. That first pass is also what exercises the emitter's assumption
// that the property storage sits directly after the object, since on the
// slow path the two cells come from JSObject::create rather than from
// alloc2InYoung.
//
// NOT covered, and why:
//  - `new` with a property-storing constructor. It was unreachable when
//    this file was written -- a function constructor's body declined on
//    PutByIdLoose, a class constructor's on GetById -- and the property
//    milestone has since landed both, so props.js covers it. A derived
//    class constructor used to decline on ThrowIfThisInitialized; since the
//    exceptions milestone it compiles, and exceptions.js's `Derived` drives
//    both that check and the ThrowIfEmpty on `this`.
//  - loadParentNoTraps: emitted only for `super` -- a super method call, a
//    super property read, or the implicit callee load in a derived
//    constructor. This file has no `super` in it, so it is not covered
//    HERE, but it is no longer uncovered: hvmodes.js's `Derived.tag` is
//    `super.tag() + 10`, and that method does compile now that getById and
//    getByIdWithReceiver both do. hvmodes.js's item 4 is where it is
//    pinned, as FunctionID 9, 'tag'.
//  - typedLoadParent: emitted only from typed-class IRGen, i.e. not from
//    plain JS at all.
//  - newTypedObjectWithBuffer: likewise typed-class only.
//  - newObjectWithBufferSlow: reached when a shape has more properties than
//    fit a young-gen allocation, or when a literal holds a double that
//    cannot be stored inline. In this build the first threshold is past two
//    thousand properties and the second never triggers, since HV64
//    SmallHermesValue inlines every double. A literal large enough to reach
//    it would dominate this file for no extra signal.
