// REQUIRES: jit

// Calls: direct and mutual recursion, the Call1-Call4 arities and the generic
// Call, construction (CreateThis/Construct/SelectObject) and higher-order
// calls through a parameter. The first RUN line is the real check --
// interpreter and JIT must print the same thing. The second re-runs it with
// the type asserts on, which turn a sync-without-free mistake around a call
// into a trap rather than a silent misread. The third is the same
// differential at -O0, where the inliner is off and every call in the file
// survives into bytecode. The fourth pins that the functions under test were
// in fact compiled at -O, so the differential cannot degrade into comparing
// the interpreter against itself. The fifth does the same for the -O0
// differential above; the FunctionIDs happen to match the -O ones for every
// function except isOdd, which the -O inliner folds into isEven but -O0
// keeps as a real call. The last one checks that the emitted code really
// took the call path, by counting the calls it made.
//
// Nothing here reaches a global binding from inside a compiled function, but
// that is no longer a compile-time necessity -- GetGlobalObject and the
// property-access opcodes both compile now (globals.js and props.js cover
// them). Every callee here still arrives either as a parameter or through
// the enclosing function's environment, which is what makes the recursive
// functions nested inside factories; that shape is kept because it is what
// isolates the call-arity opcodes under test from property access, not
// because the alternative would fail to compile.
//
// All four differential RUN lines carry -Xjit-crash-on-error, because
// nothing here declines in any of them (measured).
//
// Two paths in the emitter are exercised elsewhere, not here:
//   - Calling a non-callable, which throws: confirmed separately (a
//     try/catch around a call to a non-function value) to compile and match
//     the interpreter now that exceptions have landed.
//   - CallWithNewTargetLong (a register arg count), which comes from spread
//     and apply: confirmed separately (`f(...arr)`, `new C(...arr)`,
//     `f.apply(null, arr)`) to compile and match.
// GetBuiltinClosure is likewise exercised elsewhere: it is reachable from
// plain JS through a direct `eval(...)` call, which landed in milestone 5;
// confirmed separately to compile and match. The async/iterator lowerings
// that also produce it remain out of reach -- async through the permanent
// AsyncBreakCheck decline, iterators through opcodes this file does not
// build.
