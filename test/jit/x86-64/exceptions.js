// REQUIRES: jit

// Exceptions: Catch, Throw, ThrowIfEmpty and ThrowIfThisInitialized, plus
// the per-function catch table that leave() now emits and the SHJmpBuf /
// setjmp prologue that has been in place since the first milestone but was
// unreachable until this file.
//
// The first four RUN lines are the real check -- interpreter and JIT must
// print the same thing, at -O and -O0, with and without the type asserts --
// and they carry -Xjit-crash-on-error because every function here compiles
// in all four. The two -Xdump-jitcode=2 lines pin the compile status, so
// the differential cannot degrade into comparing the interpreter with
// itself.
//
// -fno-inline is essential, not cosmetic. Without it the optimizer inlines
// the throwers into their callers, and a throw that never crosses a JS frame
// boundary never exercises the interesting half of _jit_find_catch_target:
// its "the exception came from a callee, so read the IP out of the register
// stack's SavedIP slot" branch. With it, `boom` is its own compiled frame
// and every catch below is a cross-frame catch.
//
// WHAT THE CATCH TABLE HAS TO GET RIGHT. A JIT-compiled function with an
// exception table pushes an SHJmpBuf and calls _sh_setjmp in its prologue.
// A throw anywhere below it longjmps back to that setjmp, which returns
// non-zero, and control falls into the catch table. The table calls
// _jit_find_catch_target, which maps the throwing IP to an index in the
// bytecode exception table and returns the address of the matching handler
// basic block -- or, if no entry covers the IP, ends the try and rethrows to
// the next frame out. Three separate things must line up for that to work:
//   - the handler ORDER: the table of label deltas emitted after the
//     indirect jump is indexed by the bytecode exception table's index, so
//     the i'th delta must be the i'th entry's handler. `nested` and
//     `twoTries` below each have several entries in one function, so an
//     off-by-one or a reversal shows up as the wrong catch running.
//   - the SHJmpBuf ADDRESS: it lives at rsp + 0, which longjmp restores to
//     its setjmp-time value no matter what the throwing code was doing with
//     rsp. That placement also makes it 16-byte aligned unconditionally (see
//     frameSetup()'s layout comment) -- more than jmp_buf actually requires
//     on x86-64 (alignof(jmp_buf) == 8), but free headroom that costs
//     nothing to keep, and the alignment arm64 gets for free from its
//     architectural sp.
//   - the saved SHLocals: the JIT does not push an SHLocals of its own, so
//     the prologue stashes the runtime's on entry and the catch table hands
//     it to _sh_catch_no_pop, which is what unwinds the handle scopes and
//     the register stack. A wrong value here corrupts the GC roots, which
//     is why every RUN line in this suite runs under ASan and why the
//     `churn` case below allocates hard inside a catch.
//
// NO GLOBAL REGISTERS IN A TRY FUNCTION. longjmp restores callee-saved
// registers to their setjmp-time values, so a frame register living in one
// would present a stale value to a handler. RegisterAllocator::getRegClass
// forces RegClass::Other for any function containing a try, so no such
// function ever gets a global register, and enter() asserts it. Every
// function below with a try is therefore running entirely out of the memory
// frame -- which is also what makes the isInTry() syncs in throwInst,
// throwIfEmptyUndefinedImpl, throwIfThisInitialized and fastArrayLoad
// sufficient.
//
// THE THROWER IS NOT ALWAYS COMPILED. Under -Xjit=force every function is
// compiled, so all four -Xjit=force differential RUN lines above catch a
// throw raised by another compiled frame. The fifth RUN line covers the
// other direction:
// in threshold mode `hotCatcher` is called forty-one times and compiles,
// while `coldThrower` is called exactly once and never does, so a throw
// raised by the INTERPRETER unwinds into a compiled frame's setjmp. The
// COLD RUN line pins that asymmetry -- if coldThrower ever started
// compiling there, the case would silently stop testing anything.
//
// ThrowIfUndefined IS NOT COVERED, and cannot be from this file. It shares
// throwIfEmptyUndefinedImpl with ThrowIfEmpty and differs only in which tag
// helper the fast path uses. ISel emits it for a ThrowIfInst whose invalid
// type is Uninit, which IRGen produces only for the initialization-dead-zone
// check on a typed class field (ESTreeIRGen-expr.cpp's PrLoad path) -- i.e.
// only under -typed, which this file is not. Said here rather than left
// looking covered.
