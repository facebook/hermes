// REQUIRES: jit

// Environments, closures and the inline young-gen allocation that creating an
// environment performs. The first RUN line is the real check -- interpreter
// and JIT must print the same thing. The second re-runs it with the type
// asserts on, which turn a sync-without-free mistake around the emitted calls
// into a trap instead of a silent misread. The third pins that the functions
// under test were in fact compiled, so the differential cannot degrade into
// comparing the interpreter against itself.
//
// Restricted to plain closures and environments on purpose, without array or
// object literals or string operations -- not because those decline (they
// all compile now; arrays.js, objects.js and strings.js cover them), but to
// keep this file's shapes isolated to the one opcode family it is testing.
// Every differential RUN line above carries -Xjit-crash-on-error: nothing
// here declines, in either optimization level (measured).
//
// The -O0 RUN lines are here for coverage, not for the flag. At -O the scope
// optimizer merges every scope in this file into the function's own, so the
// only environment opcodes that survive are CreateFunctionEnvironment,
// GetParentEnvironment and the load/store pair. -O0 keeps the scopes apart
// and additionally exercises CreateEnvironment (whose parent arrives in a
// register), GetEnvironment with a non-zero level and StoreNPToEnvironment.
// The last -O0 RUN line pins four of the functions it compiles, so a future
// decline cannot quietly turn the -O0 differential into interpreter versus
// interpreter. The unprefixed CHECK lines below are the -O statuses; the
// CHECK0 lines are the -O0 ones, and the FunctionIDs differ between them
// because -O inlines functions that -O0 keeps.
//
// CreateTopLevelEnvironment IS covered here, as of the property milestone.
// It is emitted only in `global`, and `global` used to decline on
// DeclareGlobalVar in both modes, so none of its code ran. Now that
// declareGlobalVar and getGlobalObject are emitted, `global` compiles at -O
// and -O0 alike, and the first CHECK/CHECK0 pair below pins that -- which is
// what makes this file's top-level environment, and every closure created
// from it, come out of compiled code. globals.js covers the globals
// themselves.

// Captures a parameter in a mutable variable, so the closure both loads from
// and stores to the environment. The environment outlives mkCounter, so the
// slot fill and the parent pointer have to survive a GC.
function mkCounter(start) {
  var n = start;
  return function () {
    n = n + 1;
    return n;

}
// The captured variable is never stored to, so the inner function only reads
// its parent environment.
function mkAdder(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
// Curried, so the innermost closure captures one variable from its parent
// scope and one from its grandparent's. This is the only shape in the file
// whose compiled code follows Environment::parentEnvironment: at -O the scope
// optimizer flattens everything else, and a parent link written to the wrong
// field or left unwritten is invisible without it.

  return function (b) {

}
// The one shape in the file that leaves a GC point between the environment's
// allocation and the first store into its slots, which is the window the slot
// fill in emit_environment_init exists to close. The closure is stored into
// the very variable it captures, so the lowering is
//   CreateFunctionEnvironment(size 1) -> CreateClosure -> StoreToEnvironment
// and the hoisted `var x = undefined` store that would normally precede
// CreateClosure is deleted by FrameLoadStoreOpts::eliminateStores as dead.
// CreateClosure allocates, so it is a GC safepoint at which the environment
// is already reachable from the frame and slot 0 still holds whatever the
// bump allocator handed us. Every other function here stores into its slots
// before it allocates again, which is why none of them can see the fill.

// Three levels of nesting. At -O the inliner folds inner() and innermost()
// into nest, which leaves nest with no calls and no environments at all, so
// it compiles here and pins only the arithmetic. At -O0 the calls survive,
// and now that calls are implemented all three levels compile: this is the
// one place in the file where a compiled function calls another compiled
// function that reads its grandparent's environment.

// Allocate enough environments to force young-generation collections with
// some of them still live. Without this the whole file fits in one young
// generation and the GC never looks at what the emitted code wrote: an
// environment whose cell header, size field or parent link is wrong is
// invisible until something scans it. churn itself compiles too (see its
// pin below), so both the environments it builds by calling mkCounter and
