The Node-API is a standard for interaction with JS engines from native code.
It was originally developed in Node.js and currently supported by all major
JS runtimes and for all JS engines.
It is a C-based API that provides ability to interop with all modern
programming languages.

You can find more information about Node-API in

This [page](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/blob/doc/node-api-engine-bindings.md)
