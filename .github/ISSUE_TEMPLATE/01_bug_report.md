## Bug Description

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

  If it's an exception, please include the screenshots, e.g. the React Native
  RedBox screen includes a symbolicated JavaScript stack trace with a stack trace
  when Metro is running (it's grayscale monospaced text on black background below
  the red background section). Please also include a few lines of the JavaScript
  source before and after the line in which the error occurs.

  If it's an abort (e.g. app crashes), please see "Reporting crashes" from
  <https://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/master/doc/ReactNativeIntegration.md#reporting-native-crashes>
  for instructions on reporting a native crash, including symbolicating the native
  stack trace.  Note this will only work with some versions of Hermes.
