/// Sampler manages the SamplingProfiler's sampling thread, and abstracts
/// away platform-specific code for suspending the VM thread and performing the
/// JS stack walk.
///
/// Each suported platform (e.g., Posix), must have its own "flavor" of the
/// Sampler (e.g., SamplerPosix) which must implement the
/// Sampler::platform<<*>> methods.
///
/// Usually, the platform-agnostic Sampler invokes the platform-specific
/// ones. For example, Sampler::enable() performs some checks, then call
/// Sampler::platformEnable() for completing the initialization.
///
/// Sampling happens on a separate thread whose lifetime is managed by the
/// Sampler's platform-specific code. The sampling thread runs the
/// Sampler::timerLoop function, which will periodically traverse the
/// list of registered runtimes, and perform the stack walk, which is
/// accomplished as follows.
///
/// Sampler::timerLoop invokes Sampler::sampleStacks, which will
/// invoke Sampler::sampleStack for each registered runtime.
///
/// Sampler::sampleStack invoke the platform-specific
/// Sampler::suspendVMAndWalkStack method. This hook should be
/// implemented on every supported platform, and it is responsible for
/// suspending VM execution. With the stopped VM, the platform-specific code
/// calls back into platform-agnostic code (Sampler::walkRuntimeStack) so
/// stack walking can continue.
///
/// When Sampler::walkRuntimeStack runs the VM is suspended, but this
/// suspension can happen when the VM is in the middle of, e.g., memory
/// allocation, or while it is holding some lock. Thus,
/// Sampler::walkRuntimeStack should not acquire locks, or even allocate
/// memory. It should perform stack walking quickly and expeditiously. All
/// buffers used for stack walking are pre-allocated before calling into this
/// function.
///
/// Finally, when Sampler::walkRuntimeStack returns to
/// Sampler::suspendVMAndWalkStack, VM execution should be resumed.
