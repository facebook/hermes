# Incompatibilities With The JavaScript Spec

This documents aims to collect and explain deliberate differences between Static Hermes and the JavaScript spec.

## Arguments Object

### "Mapped" Arguments Object in Loose Mode

In loose mode, updates to the arguments object are not reflected in the function parameter values and vice versa.
```javascript
function foo(param) {
    arguments[0] = 10;
    print(param, arguments[0]); // Prints different values in SH
}
```

Motivation: this is a very rare case. Implementing it correctly is expensive and would impose cost on the majority of usages which do not depend on this behavior. Optimizing it, so it doesn't regress legitimate cases is possible, but complex.

This is "implementable", but with very low priority.

### Assigning to Arguments in Loose Mode

Assignment to `arguments` is prohibited in loose mode.
```javascript
function foo() {
    arguments = 0; // Allowed by the spec, but prohibited in Static Hermes
}
```

Motivation: this is a very rare case, not generally useful. Implementing it correctly is possible, but complex, with very little benefit.

This is "implementable", but with very low priority.

### Aliasing Arguments With a Var Declaration in Loose Mode

In loose mode declaring `var arguments` does not alias the arguments object. Instead it simply creates a new declaration that *shadows* the arguments object, similar to `let`.
```javascript
function foo() {
    var arguments;
    print(arguments); // Prints undefined in Static Hermes
}
```

Motivation: similar to assigning to `arguments`, this is a very rare case, with no uses that we are aware of.

This is "implementable", but with very low priority.

## Full Scoped Function Promotion Semantics in Loose Mode

Static Hermes implements most of the scoped function promotion semantics in loose mode, but some corner cases are not spec compliant yet.

```javascript
function g() {
    {
        function f() { return 1; }
        {
            function f() { return 2; }
        }
    }
    print(f());
}
g();
```

Apparently the spec requires this example to print "1", because the second `f()` shouldn't be promoted to function scope. Shermes prints "2". In our (quick and incomplete) tests, other major engines also print "2".

Motivation: these are very rare cases. Loose mode itself is rare. While we intend to address them, the priority is low.
