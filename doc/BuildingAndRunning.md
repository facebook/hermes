title: Building and Running Hermes
---

This document describes how to build and run Hermes as a standalone compiler and VM. To use Hermes in the context of a React Native app, see the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Dependencies

Hermes is a C++11 project. clang, gcc, and Visual C++ are supported. Hermes also requires cmake, git, ICU, Python, and zip. It builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org).

The Hermes REPL will also use libreadline, if available.

To install dependencies on Ubuntu:

    apt install cmake git ninja-build libicu-dev python zip libreadline-dev

On Arch Linux:

    pacman -S cmake git ninja icu python zip readline

On Mac via Homebrew:

    brew install cmake git ninja

## Building on Linux and macOS

Hermes will place its build files in the current directory by default. 
You can also give explicit source and build directories, use `--help` on the build scripts to see how.

Create a base directory to work in, e.g. ~/workspace, and cd into it. Follow the steps below to generate the Hermes build system:

    git clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
    hermes/utils/build/configure.py

The build system has now been generated in the `build` directory. To perform the build:

    cd build && ninja

## Building on Windows

The Windows build depends on which particular combination of GitBash/Cygwin/WSL and Visual Studio is used.

    git -c core.autocrlf=false clone https://github.com/facebook/hermes.git
    hermes/utils/build/configure.py --build-system='Visual Studio 16 2019' --cmake-flags='-A x64 --distribute
    cd build_release && MSBuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release

## Running Hermes

The primary binary is the `hermes` tool, which will be found at `build/bin/hermes`. This tool compiles JavaScript to Hermes bytecode. It can also execute JavaScript, from source or bytecode.

### Executing JavaScript with Hermes

    hermes test.js

## Compiling and Executing JavaScript with Bytecode

    hermes -emit-binary -out test.hbc test.js
    hermes test.hbc


## Running Tests

To run the Hermes test suite:

    ninja check-hermes


## Release Build

The above instructions create an unoptimized debug build. The `--distribute` flag will enable a release build, in the `build_release` directory. Example:

    hermes/utils/build/configure.py --distribute
    cd build_release && ninja

### Other Tools

In addition to `hermes`, the following tools will be built:

- `hdb`: JavaScript command line debugger
- `hermes-repl`: JavaScript interactive REPL
- `hbcdump`: Hermes bytecode disassembler
- `hermesc`: Standalone Hermes compiler. This can compile JavaScript to Hermes bytecode, but does not support executing it.
- `hvm`: Standalone Hermes VM. This can execute Hermes bytecode, but does not support compiling it.
