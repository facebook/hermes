## Design of the Hermes high-level IR

### Introduction
This document is a reference manual for the Hermes High-level IR. The IR is a
Static Single Assignment (SSA) based representation that captures the JavaScript
language semantics. It features optional types (values may be annotated with
types).

The IR representation is designed to be used as an in-memory form. The IR can be
dumped to human readable assembly-like format.

### Well-Formedness

This section describes the rules that define a valid IR.

  - Instructions must be dominated by their operands.

  - Basic block must end with a terminator, which is a branch instruction or a
    return instruction.

  - There has to be exactly one terminator for each basic block.

  - AllocStack instructions must appear at the 'entry' basic block (the first basic
    block in the function).

  - PHI Nodes must appear at the beginning of the basic block and must contain
    an entry for each predecessor.

### Frames:

Every JavaScript function is a closure that can capture variables from its
declaration scope. The declaration scope may be the global scope or another
function. A closure is a pair of function code, which contains the code of the
function, and a context which saves the environment that the closure may access.

Function variables that are captured by a closure are allocated in a scope on
the heap and the scope is passed as part of the context to the closure.
Closures may access variables at all nest-levels, which means that they can
access multiple scopes. We implement this feature by nesting scopes and linking
them together. Each scope (the set of captured variables) also has a reference
to the scope of the caller function. Closures can access variables at different
nesting levels by loading the parent scope for each scope.

At the IR Level we define a few instructions that can load and store frame
variables.  Functions own variables, that are storage units that represent
variables at the source level.  These variables can be optimized away or
promoted to the stack, etc.  We define the AllocStack instruction for allocating
variable storage. The only instructions that can access the storage values
(Variable and AllocStack) are the Load and Store instructions. It is not
possible to save the address of the allocation itself. Depending on the
implementation of the virtual machine, the heap allocations may be packed into a
single frame.


### Types:

The Hermes high-level IR is optionally typed. Values may be annotated with the
expected type of the value. The types are optional and untyped programs are
correct. The types represent primitive JavaScript types, or refinement of these
types. All values can be annotated with types: Functions, Instructions and
Parameters. Annotations of functions represent the type of the returned value.
The type annotations are not a suggestion or a hint. They must be correct and
consistent or else the program may fail at run time. Programs are expected to
run and have the same semantics when the type annotations are stripped.

Some instructions in the IR expect operands of specific types, or produce
specific types.  For example, the CondBranch instruction expects the condition
operand to be annotated as a boolean type. The ToBool instruction produces
values that are annotated as boolean type.

The optimizer may optimize the IR based on type annotations. For example, if the
operand of the instruction ToBool is annotated with the boolean type then the
optimizer is free to remove the instruction and replace all uses with the
operand of the conversion instruction.

### Example:

This is a short example of a valid program in textual IR. The function contains
four basic blocks with a few instructions. The code below follow the
requirements of a well-formed function defined in the previous section.

      function forEach(cond : boolean, value : number)
        %BB0:
          %0 = BranchInst %BB1
        %BB1:
          %2 = CondBranchInst %cond, %BB2, %BB3
        %BB2:
          %3 = ReturnInst %cond
        %BB3:
          %4 = ReturnInst %value


### Side Effects:

The instructions in the IR are annotated with side effect labels. The
labels describe the kind of effect the instruction has on memory, IO
state (for example, hardware IO such as drawing to a screen or sending
a network packet), and whether they can throw. The two kind of memory
side effects are 'read' and 'write'.  ('write' actually indicates
"read and/or write".)  These side effect specifications indicate that
the instruction does not have IO effects or throw.  The 'unknown' side
effect is maximally conservative: it indicates that the instruction
may read, write, have IO effects, and/or throw.  These side effect
annotations allow the optimizer to decide which optimizations are
legal. For example, it is not legal to sink instructions that can
write to memory past each other. It is not legal to hoist instructions
that read to memory outside of a loop if there is another instruction
that writes to memory in that loop, because the writer instruction may
clobber memory that the reader may read.

Some instructions that allocate memory are marked as not having any side
effects.  This is because the instructions only touch the newly allocated memory
and do not influence the rest of the heap. Notice that we don't model the effect
of instructions on the garbage collector or anything like that, just the content
of the allocated memory.

## Register allocation

In Hermes, register allocation is performed on the IR. An infinite number of
virtual registers are allocated while preserving the constraints of the IR and
of the low-level target. Registers are allocated in an attempt to reduce the
number of registers, values across PhiNodes are coalesced, AllocStack
instructions are assigned with a dedicated register and arguments to call
instructions are placed in consecutive registers.

While in SSA form, the IR does not support all of the things that can be done
with registers. This is why the Register Allocator introduces MOV instructions
that represent a copy of one register to another. We lower some of the
load/store instructions into MOVs, and spill registers with MOV instructions.

## Generator Overview

When generating the IR for a generator function, we make two functions:
an outer GeneratorFunction and an inner function.
The outer function calls CreateGenerator on the inner function,
and returns the resultant generator.

The inner function assumes that it can store and retrieve state from
its own closure. As such, it contains instructions to start, save/yield,
and resume generators.

CreateGenerator:
An instruction to create a generator given a `Function`.
First, it creates an inner GeneratorInnerFunction, then it wraps it in a Generator object.
Used by the GeneratorFunction to create the generator which is returned upon calling it.

StartGenerator:
Always the first instruction executed when an inner function is called.
Restores values for all local variables in the generator,
and jumps to the resume point of the generator if it's suspended.
If the generator hasn't been started yet, simply continues execution.

SaveAndYield:
Saves necessary state to the closure and yields execution.
In practice, this will save state and use the return opcode to
allow the caller to get the yield result.
Emitting a SaveAndYield also emits its corresponding ResumeGenerator.

ResumeGenerator:
Placed at the start of the block following the SaveAndYield to which it
corresponds. Resumes execution by loading context from the closure,
and then using state stored in the closure, does one of 3 things:
- Continues execution with the result of the instruction being the
  argument to `.next()`.
- Throws a value immediately
- Sets an `%isReturn` flag to true, which later instructions may branch on to execute the `finally`
  if necessary, and then return.

Semantics | If the user requested next(), continue on. If the user requested throw(), throw. If the user requested return(), set %isReturn to true and continue. Subsequent instructions will check %isReturn and execute any `finally` handlers, for example, before returning.
Effects | May read and write memory. (may throw)

### IteratorBegin

IteratorBegin | _
Description | Begins array destructuring on a given iterable source.
Example |  %0 = IteratorBegin %sourceOrNext
Arguments | %sourceOrNext[in/out] is the stack location for source to destructure from. Is set to source if performing array iteration, else set to the `.next()` method of the iterator.
Semantics | If %sourceOrNext is an Array then it remains unmodified and the instruction returns `0`, but if it is not, it is replaced with the 'next' method so that it can be called on each step of the iteration and the instruction returns the iterator object. If the `[Symbol.iterator]` function throws, this instruction will throw.
Effects | May read and write memory, may throw or execute.

### IteratorNext

IteratorNext | _
Description | Destructures the next value from a given iterator.
Example |  %0 = IteratorNext %iterator %sourceOrNext
Arguments | %iterator is the index or the iterator. %sourceOrNext is the input stack location (source to destructure from) or the next method.
Semantics | If %iterator is an index: if %iterator is less than `%sourceOrNext.length`, reads the value from %sourceOrNext and increments the index, else sets %iterator to undefined and returns undefined. If %iterator is an actual iterator, calls %sourceOrNext as a next method and evaluates to the result value. When iteration is complete, sets %iterator to undefined as a signal that we're done.
```
if (typeof %iterator === 'undefined') {
  return undefined;
}
if (typeof %iterator === 'number') {
  if (%iterator >= %sourceOrNext.length) {
    %iterator = undefined;
    return undefined;
  }
  return %sourceOrNext[%iterator];
}
var iterResult = %sourceOrNext();
if (iterResult.done) {
  %iterator = undefined;
  return undefined;
}
return iterResult.value;
```
Effects | May read and write memory, may throw or execute.

### IteratorClose

IteratorClose | _
Description | Closes an iterator if it exists.
Example |  %0 = IteratorClose %iterator %ignoreInnerException
Arguments | %iterator is the index or the iterator. %ignoreInnerException is a boolean literal.
Semantics | If %iterator is an iterator, calls `.return()` on it to close it. Otherwise, this is a no-op. If `.return()` throws, the exception is ignored when %ignoreInnerException is true.
Effects | May read and write memory, may throw or execute.

### UnreachableInst

UnreachableInst | _
--- | --- |
Description | Crashes the VM (ifndef NDEBUG).
Example |  %0 = UnreachableInst
Arguments | None.
Semantics | Can be added to stubs and similar to verify that they are never executed.
Effects | Marked as reading/writing memory to avoid reordering.

## Target Instructions

Some high-level IR instructions are lowered into a sequence of low-level machine
instructions. In order to perform register allocation on these instructions we
need to perform lowering, which is a form of instruction selection. The semantic
of these instructions are identical to the semantic of the relevant target
instructions.

### HBCGetGlobalObjectInst

HBCGetGlobalObjectInst | _
--- | --- |
Description | Obtain the "global" object
Example |  %0 = HBCGetGlobalObjectInst
Arguments | None.
Semantics | The instruction returns a reference to the "global" object.
Effects | Does not read or write to memory.

### HBCCreateFunction

HBCCreateFunction | _
--- | --- |
Description | Create a new closure capturing the specified environment and using the specified body
Example | %0 = HBCCreateFunction %environment, %body,
Arguments | %environment is the closure's environment. %body is the closure's body.
Semantics | The instruction creates a new closure that may access the specified environment.
Effects | Does not read or write to memory.

### HBCCreateGenerator

CreateGenerator | _
--- | --- |
Description | Constructs a new Generator into the current scope from its code representation.
Example | %0 = CreateGenerator %environment, %body,
Arguments | %environment is the closure's environment, %body is the closure's body.
Semantics | The instruction creates a new GeneratorInnerFunction access the environment and wraps it in a Generator.
Effects | Does not read or write to memory.

### HBCAllocObjectFromBufferInst

HBCAllocObjectFromBufferInst | _
--- | --- |
Description | Allocates a new JavaScript object on the heap, and initializes it with values from the object buffer.
Example |  %0 = HBCAllocObjectFromBufferInst %value0, %value1, ...
Arguments | The values are all literal values, with alternating keys and values. Non-literal values will be inserted into the array separately.
Semantics | The instruction creates a new JavaScript object on the heap with an initial list of properties.
Effects | Does not read or write to memory.

### HBCCallNInst

HBCCallNInst | _
--- | --- |
Description | Calls a function with a fixed number of arguments (from 1 to 4, inclusive).
Example | %0 = HBCCallNInst %callee, %this, %arg0, %arg1, %arg2
Arguments | %callee is the function to execute. %this is a reference to the 'this' value. Arguments %arg0 ... %argN are the arguments passed to the function.
Semantics | The instruction copies its arguments (starting from this) into the parameter-passing registers at the end of the frame, and passes the control to the callee, which must be of closure type. The arguments are mapped to the parameters. Unmapped parameters are initialized to 'undefined'.
Effects | May read and write memory.
