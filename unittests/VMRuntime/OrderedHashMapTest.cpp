/// callback), the iterator's index still points at the now-deleted slot. If
/// that deletion triggers a rehash (shrink or grow), the data table is
/// compacted. The iterator index must be adjusted to account for removed
/// deleted entries. Using std::lower_bound (>=) fails to count the deleted
/// entry at the iterator's own position, causing the adjusted index to be 1 too
/// high and skipping the next valid entry. Using std::upper_bound (>) correctly
/// counts it.
