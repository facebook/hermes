//
// TrigramIndex implements a heuristic for SpecialCaseList that allows to
// filter out ~99% incoming queries when all regular expressions in the
// SpecialCaseList are simple wildcards with '*' and '.'. If rules are more
// complicated, the check is defeated and it will always pass the queries to a
// full regex.
//
// The basic idea is that in order for a wildcard to match a query, the query
// needs to have all trigrams which occur in the wildcard. We create a trigram
// index (trigram -> list of rules with it) and then count trigrams in the query
// for each rule. If the count for one of the rules reaches the expected value,
// the check passes the query to a regex. If none of the rules got enough
// trigrams, the check tells that the query is definitely not matched by any
// of the rules, and no regex matching is needed.
// A similar idea was used in Google Code Search as described in the blog post:
// https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html
