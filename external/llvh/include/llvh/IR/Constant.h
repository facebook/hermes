/// This is an important base class in LLVM. It provides the common facilities
/// of all constant values in an LLVM program. A constant is a value that is
/// immutable at runtime. Functions are constants because their address is
/// immutable. Same with global variables.
///
/// All constants share the capabilities provided in this class. All constants
/// can have a null value. They can have an operand list. Constants can be
/// simple (integer and floating point values), complex (arrays and structures),
/// or expression based (computations yielding a constant value composed of
/// only certain operators and other constant values).
///
/// Note that Constants are immutable (once created they never change)
/// and are fully shared by structural equivalence.  This means that two
/// structurally equivalent constants will always have the same address.
/// Constants are created on demand as needed and never deleted: thus clients
/// don't have to worry about the lifetime of the objects.
