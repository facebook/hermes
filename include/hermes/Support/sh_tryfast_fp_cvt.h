/// \file
/// This file defines the following functions/macros on supported platforms and
/// compilers:
/// \code
///      bool sh_tryfast_f64_to_i32(double x, int32_t &intres);
///      bool sh_tryfast_f64_to_u32(double x, uint32_t &intres);
///      bool sh_tryfast_f64_to_i64(double x, int64_t &intres);
///      bool sh_tryfast_f64_to_u64(double x, uint64_t &intres);
/// \endcode
///
/// These should be used for optimistically attempting to convert a f64 to an
/// integer. The conversion succeeds if the input is representable as an integer
/// of the appropriate size and signedness \b and for 64-bit integers other
/// implementation-defined restrictions on the input are also met.
///
/// The idea is to use these fast implementations when there is a high
/// probability that the input is representable as an integer. If they fail,
/// a slower algorithm may be needed.
///
/// The implementation depends on the following helpers, which are also exposed:
///
/// \code
///      int32_t _sh_tryfast_f64_to_i32_cvt(double);
///      uint32_t _sh_tryfast_f64_to_u32_cvt(double);
///      int64_t _sh_tryfast_f64_to_i64_cvt(double);
///      uint64_t _sh_tryfast_f64_to_u64_cvt(double);
/// \endcode
///
/// These helpers convert from f64 to an integer without undefined behavior,
/// unlike a C cast. The i32/u32 versions are guaranteed to return a correctly
/// truncated value if the input is in range, or an implementation-dependent
/// value otherwise. The i64/u64 versions are not guaranteed to return a correct
/// value, but in practice they do most of the time.
///
/// The only correct way to use these helpers is by round-tripping, that is
/// casting back to double and comparing in order to determine whether the
/// conversion was a success. Like this:
/// \code
///   int64_t i = _sh_tryfast_f64_to_i64_cvt(d);
///   if ((double)i == d) ...
/// \endcode
///
/// This check can provide false negatives: in other words, it can fail even if
/// the input value was in range. However, the check will never generate false
/// positives, it other words it will never succeed if the input value is
/// invalid.
///
/// The higher level functions \c sh_tryfast_f64_to_iXX() simple wrap the
/// conversion and the comparison.
///
/// \section Fast or Slow 64-bit Conversion
///
/// This file always defines the following define to 1 or 0.
/// \code
/// #define HERMES_TRYFAST_F64_TO_64_IS_FAST 0 or 1
/// \endcode
/// 1 indicates that the truncation to a 64-bit integer can be considered
/// "fast" or at least "as fast as converting to 32-bit integer".
///
/// \section Unsupported Platforms
///
/// The file errors by default if an unsupported platform/compiler is
/// encountered unless HERMES_TRYFAST_FP_CVT_ENABLE_UNSUPPORTED is defined.
/// This enables safe but perhaps slower implementations on unsupported
/// platforms.
///
/// \section Challenges of round-tripping
///
/// In JS fast paths it is often necessary to quickly check whether a double
/// is representable as some integer type. We do it by "round-tripping"
/// (converting to integer, then back to double, then comparing):
/// \code
///   int64_t i = (int64_t)d;
///   if ((double)i == d) ...
/// \endcode
/// There are two problems in this code.
///
/// First, there is UB when \c d is out-of-range of \c int64_t. This
/// problem is solved by using the new UB-lessconversion functions provided
/// here.
///
/// The second problem is more subtle. When naively converting from double to a
/// 64-bit integer (signed or unsigned), round-tripping is not always guaranteed
/// to work. Certain cases can cause loss of precision, leading to false
/// positives in the comparison.
///
/// If the input double is within the range of i64, the underlying hardware
/// conversion produces an integer which can always be converted back to f64
/// without loss of precision.
///
/// However, when the conversion from double to i64 overflows (the value of the
/// double does not fit inside i64), the conversion produces an architecture-
/// dependent bit pattern as a result.
///
/// This arbitrary 64-bit pattern is not necessarily convertable to f64
/// accurately, because a double only has 53 bits of precision. In such cases
/// the pattern is converted to the closest representable double. It may so
/// happen that the resulting double value is the same as the original value,
/// which caused the overflow! So, the comparison will compare equal, even
/// though the double is not representable as an integer. A false positive,
/// which we cannot allow!
///
/// To make it clear, let's go through the steps.
/// 1. Input value `d` is larger than int64_t.
/// 2. The conversion `int64_t i = (int64_t)d;` causes an overflow, and the
/// "overflow" bit pattern is stored in `i`.
/// 3. The pattern in `i` has more than 53 significant bits, so it is not
/// representable as a f64 value without loss of precision.
/// 4. The conversion `(double)i` converts it to the closest representable
/// f64, which unfortunately happens to be the original `d`.
/// 5. The comparison `(double)i == d` succeeds incorrectly!
///
/// To avoid this problem we modify the behavior of the hardware conversion.
/// Our implementation is guaranteed to always return a value suitable for
/// round-tripping, at the cost of false negatives.
///
/// We achieve this by narrowing the set of the convertable values, in
/// order to ensure that the returned value can always be compared correctly.
/// That is, we have to produce false negatives: some values which theoretically
/// are representable as integers will be treated as if they are not.
///
/// \section Implementation
///
/// It turns out that only some bit patterns are "problematic" and only for
/// positive numbers (we are assuming IEEE 754 and twos-complement, etc.).
///
/// Let's look at converting to u64 first. In order for the conversion back to
/// f64 to potentially produce a value that is not representable as u64, its
/// highest bit must be set (otherwise it would be too small).
///
/// For example 2**64-1 (0xFFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF) is not accurately representable as
/// f64 and is rounded to the nearest double: 2*64, which is outside the u64
/// range. If the highest bit (2**63) is not set, the value is smaller than
/// 2**63 and the closest representable double will always be in range.
///
/// So, all we have to do is clear bit 63 of the u64 result. This guarantees
/// that the comparison has no false positives. Note that this works regardless
/// of the underlying CPU architecture.
///
/// Now let's examine i64. The bit pattern could be negative or positive.
///
/// Let's look at negative patterns first: the most negative 64-bit number is
/// -2**63 (0x80000000_00000000). It is representable as a double without loss
/// of precision, so it cannot cause overflow. Any other negative number would,
/// at worst, be converted to -2**63. So, all negative i64 patterns are "safe".
///
/// The most positive i64 value is 2**63-1 (0x7FFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF). It cannot be
/// represented exactly as f64, instead it is rounded to 2**63, which causes
/// overflow. Any other smaller values will, at worst, be rounded up to 2**63
/// as well. In order for a positive bit pattern to be "at risk", its bit 62
/// must be set, otherwise it would be too small.
///
/// How can we deal with that? A simple solution would be to mask out bit 62.
/// (This also causes false negatives for negative patterns with a 1 in bit 62).
/// Another solution is to do a left shift, followed by a signed right
/// shift, which is a single sbfx instruction on arm64. This turns "at risk"
/// positive patterns into negative integers. (Similarly, it causes false
/// negatives for negative patterns with 0 bit 62, by turning them into "safe"
/// positive patterns). Since negative numbers with 1 in bit 62 are common in
/// practice, we prefer the shift approach.
///
/// These are the actual bit patterns that we know are returned by different
/// hardware architectures:
/// - arm64 clamps the value to the largest/smallest representable value in the
/// integer: u64 -> [0..2**64-1]. i64 -> [-2**63..2**63-1].
/// - x86/x86-64 always sets the highest bit and clears all the rest of the
/// result.
///
/// Note that x86 doesn't need any mitigations because it always generates
/// -2**63, which is a safe pattern.
