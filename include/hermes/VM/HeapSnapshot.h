/// Some things to note about the format:
/// * Chrome only stores the declaration of each function in a stack frame, not
///   which lines called each other, or which line allocated an object.
/// * selfSize in each frame denotes how many bytes are allocated in that
///   function
/// * lineNumber and columnNumber are 0-based, whereas most editors display line
///   numbers starting at 1.
/// * In the samples section, each sample tuple is the size of the heap, the id
///   of the stack frame node described in the "head" section. "ordinal"
///   describes the chronological order of samples. Samples are not placed in
///   the JSON format in the order in which they occurred, but in an arbitrary
///   order based on the call graph. "ordinal" is used to re-order them into a
///   timeline of when allocations happened.
/// * Each sample internally tracks the count of how many allocations of a given
///   size happened. This is then translated to an estimate of the true number
///   of allocations that occurred at a spot, based on the sampling process.
/// * When a sampled allocation is deleted, the count and size are decremented.
///   this process is meant to track only memory that is still alive at the time
///   that the profile is reported back to the user. This means if a function
///   creates a lot of garbage, that will not be reported by this profile.
/// This format is much less optimized than the Chrome heap snapshot or heap
/// profile format, and uses very basic JSON. It is also a completely separate
/// format from a heap snapshot, hence why it's a different class. It re-uses a
/// StackTracesTree to share information with normal heap profiles.
