/// Serialization and Deserialization (S/D): The basic idea of S/D
/// VM state is to S/D a graph of entities and each entity knows how to S/D
/// itself. Pointer values (GC pointers and native pointers) will need to be
/// relocated so they can point to the correct address after objects are
/// reconstructed during deserialization. During serialization, each address
/// will be givin a relocation id when it is first seen and this relocation id
/// will be written to the serialized stream. During deserialization each
/// relocation id will be able to know its new address after the entitie is
/// reconstructed. Note that we decide to do relocation after S/D-ing an entity
/// (Serializer::endObject and Deserializer::endObject) instead of before so
/// that it's easier to handle VariableSizeRuntimeCell.
///
/// We distinguish between the following kinds of pointers: NativePointers,
/// GCPointers, pointers in HermesValue, and function pointers (used by
/// NativeFunction and NativeConstructor). Specifically for relocation, we map
/// nullptr to id 0 in both Serializer and Deserializer so that we can deal with
/// nullptr gracefully during S/D.

/// Deserializer: The Deserializer API will wrap a llvh::MemoryBuffer with a
/// running pointer (and provide unaligned reads from that pointer). We also
/// have a objectTable_ to map relocation id to the new pointer values. Whenever
/// an entity is deserialized, we will be able to update the mapping of its
/// relocation id to the new address. When a forward reference is read, the
/// address where the reference was supposed to be stored are recorded in
/// relocationQueue_. In the end, the queue is flushed to update all outstanding
/// forward references.

/// When we start deserialization, we first read the
/// relocationMap size from the end of the serialized data and resize
/// objectTable_ to that size. We then reconstruct the char* and char16_t*
/// buffers that holds the static string literals.
