/// This is the root of a tree encoding stack-traces for use by the allocation
/// location tracker. The idea is to minimize the amount of storage needed per
/// stack-trace, and time taken to capture a trace by exploiting the fact that
/// many traces will have a common prefix. An alternative but simpler
/// implementation would just capture a full stack-trace as a string per
/// allocated object.
///
/// Each node in the tree represents a bytecode location, and a single
/// stack-trace is represented by leaf nodes in the tree. For a given leaf we
/// can re-construct the call-stack by walking up from the leaf to the root.
///
/// Operation is as follows:
/// * A single StackTracesTree instance lives in Runtime.
/// * Every time a CodeBlock is entered, \c pushCallStack() must be called, when
///   exited \c popCallStack() must be called. These are O(1) operations
///   (relative to current stack size).
/// * To capture a stack trace, call \c getStackTrace(). This is also an O(1) as
///   we have been tracking where we are in the stack up to this point.
/// * Whenever allocation location tracking is first enabled we must call
///   \c syncWithRuntimeStack() which os O(size of current stack) to initially
///   populate the tree.
///
/// Whenever \c pushCallStack() is called a new entry in the tree is only
/// created if there isn't an existing node for the current "code-location".
/// Code location in this case is distinguished by [script name, line no., col.
/// no.] as these are the values which are important when re-constructing a
/// stack-trace. See StackTracesTree-NoRuntime.h for more details.
///
/// All strings used in the trace (function names, script names, etc.) are
/// encoded as indexes into a single table to reduce memory usage. This table
/// can be shared with the heap snapshot infrastructure as Chrome snapshots also
/// use this mapping.
