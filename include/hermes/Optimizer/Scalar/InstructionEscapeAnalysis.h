/// Analysis that finds sections of blocks where at most one value escapes.
///
/// This class accepts a range of instructions within a basic block and finds
/// prefixes of the range where at most one value escapes. A value "escapes" if
/// the instruction value is used as an operand somewhere outside the range.
///
/// In addition, the analysis supports adding more ranges of instructions and
/// reporting prefixes lengths that are compatible with all ranges analyzed so
/// far. A prefix length is compatible with N ranges of instructions if (1) the
/// length does not exceed the length of the shortest range, (2) the prefix of
/// each range has at most one escaping value, and (3) the prefixes that have
/// exactly one escaping value have that value at the same offset.
///
/// This is useful for identifying ranges of instructions that can be refactored
/// into a function with a single return value.
///
/// Here is an example of a block of pseudocode instructions, with annotations
/// indicating which values escape from each prefix of the range:
///
/// \code
///     (L1) | A = X + 1
///          +-----------> escapes: [A on L3]
///     (L2) | B = 2 * 3
///          +-----------> escapes: [A on L3, B on L3]
///     (L3) | C = A - B
///          +-----------> escapes: [C on L4/L5]
///     (L4) | D = C * C
///          +-----------> escapes: [C on L5, D on L5/L6]
///     (L5) | E = sin(C)
///          +-----------> escapes: [D on L6]
///     (L6) | F = cos(D)
///          +-----------> escapes: []
/// \endcode
///
/// In this case, the prefixes of length 1, 3, 5, and 6 have at most one value
/// escaping. If the input range were just L1-L4, then this class would report
/// L1-L3 as the best (longest) prefix. Notice that a value only counts as one
/// escape even if it's used in multiple locations after the prefix.
